# phone-number-contant
This is a PHP project I wrote in my internship at Son compony, to handle a phone number contant system.

At the beginning, the program will check that if you ever saved your datas to a file name data.json and if it is set, restore numbers.

You can add your contant to system by insert command. just remember that you can not add a repeatable name and also your phone number will be check to be either by cellphone numbers or landline phones.

Then you can update and clear by name.
get and list by a specific key.
at the end you can search and list items.
in the search method, you will be given all the items even if you hadn't printed the whole word and will rank them by their similarity to the word you searched for.
